        <p class="center large"> Welcome to my top 3 favorite Football players! There are so many fantastic Footballers to talk about, 
        so it's no suprise that this list was very hard to make!</p>

        <p>We start bylooking at their greatest achievements and what steps they took to get there!></p>

        <h1>Number 1. lionel messi</h1>
        <p> Where to start? Is he a Man or a Machine? Just kidding! But it's fair to say he is the best.
            he won a club-record 34 major trophies with Barcelona, including 10 La Liga titles,
            four Champions Leagues, seven Copa del Rey titles, seven Spanish Super Cups,
            three UEFA Super Cups and three FIFA Club World Cups. Not to mention 7 Ballon d'or awards!</p>

        <h1>Number 2. Ronaldo Naz√°rio</h1>
        <p> Despite not having the same credentials as Messi (your not the only one!)
         Ronaldo was equally as gifted in his own unique way. He won the world cup with Brazil!
         and was awarded player of the year at just 20. He was awarded this 3 times
         despite never winning a champions league! how?!</p>

        <h1>Number 3. Diego Maradona</h1>
        <p> He was named the greatest Footballer of all time. 
            He scored the greatest goal of all time against england, 
            went on to win the world cup.<p>
